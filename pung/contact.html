            Well, i mus admit i'm kinda ognna take osme pleasure form this lil butit of pointlessness:
            this is my weird internet ship-in-a-bottle - set adrift to see if in 100yrs time it bobs
            ashore near some weirded out person who's never heard of the coincepot and decides they dont care for it one bit.
            So, for those of you with waaaay too much time/patience who have somehow managed to come this far here's your reward:
        
            Tel: [yes, this is a real, live telephone number, actually conected to _my_ phone and you )_can_ call me on it - give it a go!]:
            +1(737)407-1407 [yurp, that's texas number riiiight thur!] [[it's voip silly - just a burner - i'm not _thaaaaat_ dumb :D]]
        
            email: slendernskinny@whispr.dev

            address: [like _ayone ever uses smnailmail thresedays eh?]
            The Slender Man, 5 Blackberry Place, Cefnpennar, MOUNTAIN ASH, RCT, CF45 4EA, UK.

            WhatsApp, Telegeram, Signal, Instagram, Discord, etc. may all appear in the near future if i'm waaaaay too bored for my own good - keep 'em peeled, eh?'

            whispr.dev sister sites you may also enjoy if this has for some strange reason in anyway kept you occupied for a moment:
            - whispr.dev itself                 sill haven't decided if this is going to be real or not. seems like a lot of work, but could ve real fun.
            - DailyStonks.whispr.dev/signup     this is proving slower than i'd hoped but i swear i actually intend to try and bring this to life
            - stealingdataisgay.whispr.dev      this is the dumbest idea i've ever had so it'll probably make me rich
            - analoglogic.blog/fuzzylo.gic      this is my belived blog, which i curate to house all things just plain well... interestng i guess.
            - ryomodular.com                    the boring, actual real straight edge i'm not bring silly here real business i run
            - cdnedu.online                     welp, not got an excuse for this - it's got not real place orm purpose other than i was kinda hoping to
            academic joirnals/reasearch papers for free... hehehe.
            - gotgirl.cam                       i'm not quite sure what's gonna live here but something special for sure - i owe it that much... but am 
            afraid i dont even a=ave a parking oage thhere rn. oop                       
            - fastping.it.com                   you ever need to test a proxy to see if it's live? or test your email to see if it's actually returnin 
            stuff but don't wanna wait like 12hrs for t to process thru? or maybe you just like building ridiculously nerdy projects that take waaaay too 
            much stressing for an end result that is, well... just a server that sends stuff back again reeeeeal quick. i can lay claim to all three of 
            those reasons and more...
    
            and thatr pretty much rounds off _my_collection of ridiculous internet speces for makin other people less bored for now. so now you've 
            experienced what it's REALLY all about - of all things, yes, the contact us page!
